# Landing Page Project

## ðŸ“„ Project Description

This is a simple and responsive landing page built using only **HTML** and **CSS**. The project was completed in approximately **3 hours** as a fast-paced exercise to improve layout structuring and styling skills using **Flexbox**.

The landing page includes:

- A navigation header with links
- A hero section with a call-to-action button and image placeholder
- An information section with feature boxes
- A styled quote section
- A call-to-action banner
- A footer

The main goal of this project was to gain practical experience in designing clean and organized layouts from scratch, without using any JavaScript or external libraries. It was created as part of a self-paced learning journey to strengthen core front-end development skills.
